Data to pull:
- On ufc.com, start at fighter rankings page: http://www.ufc.com/rankings?fb_comment_id=6086517324953#f10c8f9e6edcfe
- for each fighter, pull their reach and the results of each fight with other fighters who are also on the list
- should now have a dataset of reach differential and fight results between top competitors in order to feed into the logistic regression function
